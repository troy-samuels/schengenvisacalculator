## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Notes

ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN subscription_tier text DEFAULT 'free';
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN trip_count integer DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN created_at timestamp DEFAULT now();

-- New tables for team management
CREATE TABLE organizations (
  id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  name text NOT NULL,
  subscription_tier text DEFAULT 'enterprise',
  created_at timestamp DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE TABLE organization_members (
  id uuid DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  organization_id uuid REFERENCES organizations(id),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES profiles(id),
  role text DEFAULT 'member',
  created_at timestamp DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Environment Variables to Add
```bash
# Email service
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_key
FROM_EMAIL=info@etiascalculator.com
CONTACT_EMAIL=info@etiascalculator.com
SUPPORT_EMAIL=info@etiascalculator.com

# Affiliate tracking
SAFETYWING_API_KEY=your_safetywing_key
BOOKING_AFFILIATE_ID=your_booking_id

```

### Feature Flag Implementation
```typescript
// Feature flag checking utility
export function hasFeature(tier: SubscriptionTier, feature: string): boolean {
  const FEATURES = {
    [SubscriptionTier.FREE]: [
      'basic_calculator',
      'date_overlap_prevention',
      'screenshot_export'
    ],
    [SubscriptionTier.PREMIUM]: [
      'unlimited_trips',
      'analytics_dashboard',
      'pdf_export',
      'email_alerts',
      'multiple_passports'
    ],

      'api_access',
      'white_label',
      'custom_reporting',
      'dedicated_support'
    ]
  };
  
  return FEATURES[tier]?.includes(feature) || false;
}
```
