Hi [First Name],

On **October 12, 2025**, the EU Entry/Exit System (EES) goes live across all 27 Schengen countries.

**What this means for you:**

• Fingerprint scans (all 10 fingers)
• Facial photograph capture
• Digital travel record (replaces passport stamps)
• First-time registration: 5-10 minutes
• Automatic 90/180 day tracking

**No exceptions. No opt-out. Every traveler.**
