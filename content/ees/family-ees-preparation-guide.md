# Family EES Preparation Guide: Multi-Person Registration & Coordination

*The complete guide to preparing your family for EU biometric border control | By EU Border Authority*

Planning family travel to Europe just got more complex with the EES (Entry/Exit System) launching in October 2025. This comprehensive guide helps families navigate biometric registration, coordinate multiple family members, and ensure smooth border crossings for everyone from grandparents to toddlers.

## Family EES Overview: What Every Family Needs to Know

The Entry/Exit System will require biometric registration for every non-EU family member, but the process varies significantly by age and circumstances. Understanding these requirements before you travel is essential for avoiding delays, confusion, and potential compliance issues.

### Family EES Quick Facts:
- **Each person registers individually** (no group processing)
- **Age-based requirements** determine biometric capture
- **Family lanes available** at most major border points
- **Children under 6 exempt** from biometric capture
- **Coordination essential** for compliance tracking

## Age-Based EES Requirements for Families

### Adults (18+ years):
- ✅ **Full biometric registration** required
- ✅ **Fingerprints**: All 10 fingers scanned
- ✅ **Facial photograph**: High-resolution capture
- ✅ **Travel document**: Digital scan and verification
- ✅ **Independent tracking**: Individual 90/180-day compliance

### Teenagers (12-17 years):
- ✅ **Full biometric registration** required
- ✅ **Fingerprints**: All 10 fingers scanned
- ✅ **Facial photograph**: High-resolution capture
- ✅ **Parental presence**: Required during registration
- ✅ **Individual compliance**: Tracked separately from parents

### Children (6-11 years):
- ⚠️ **Partial biometric registration**

## Family EES Registration Process: Step-by-Step

### Before You Travel (7+ Days):

1. **Verify Family Documentation**
   - Ensure all passports valid for 3+ months
   - Confirm biometric passport compliance
   - Check each family member's EES requirements

2. **Prepare Children for Biometric Procedures**
   - Explain the fingerprint and photo process
   - Practice standing still for photographs
   - Prepare for potential multiple attempts

3. **Plan Border Crossing Timing**
   - Allow extra time for family registration
   - Consider arrival during off-peak hours
   - Account for potential system delays

### At the Border: Family Registration Strategy

#### Option 1: Family Lanes (Recommended)
Most major airports offer dedicated family processing lanes:

**Advantages**:
- Staff trained in family procedures
- Child-friendly processing environment
- Coordinated registration for all members
- Reduced stress for parents and children

**Process**:
1. **Approach family lane** with all members
2. **Present all passports** to border official
3. **Register adults first** (parents/guardians)
4. **Process teenagers** with parental supervision
5. **Register children 6+** with assistance
6. **Verify young children** through document check

#### Option 2: Standard EES Kiosks
If family lanes unavailable, use standard processing:

**Strategy**:
1. **Adults process first** at separate kiosks
2. **Teenagers follow** with adult supervision
3. **Children 6-11** assisted by parent at kiosk
4. **Regroup after processing** before customs

### Family Registration Timeline Expectations:

| Family Size | First-Time Registration | Subsequent Visits |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **2 Adults** | 8-12 minutes | 2-3 minutes |
| **2 Adults + 1 Teen** | 12-18 minutes | 3-4 minutes |
| **2 Adults + 2 Children** | 15-25 minutes | 4-6 minutes |
| **Grandparents + Family** | 20-30 minutes | 6-8 minutes |

*Times based on pilot program data and EU estimates*

## Age-Specific EES Guidance for Families

### Preparing Teenagers (12-17):

**Before Travel**:
- Explain the biometric process and its purpose
- Discuss privacy protections and data use
- Prepare valid identification documents
- Plan for parental presence during registration

**At the Border**:
- Parent/guardian must accompany minor
- Allow teenager to interact with system directly
- Be prepared to assist if registration difficulties occur
- Confirm successful registration before proceeding

**Common Issues**:
- **Fingerprint quality**: Teenagers may have difficulty with fingerprint capture
- **Nervousness**: Anxiety can affect biometric capture quality
- **Height adjustments**: Kiosks may need adjustment for shorter teens

### Managing Children (6-11):

**Before Travel**:
- Practice fingerprint positioning (games/play)
- Explain the "special photo" they'll take
- Prepare for potential multiple attempts
- Bring comfort items for waiting periods

**At the Border**:
- Stay calm and patient throughout process
- Assist with hand positioning for photographs
- Be prepared for manual processing if needed
- Praise cooperation to encourage compliance

**Common Challenges**:
- **Fidgeting**: Children may have difficulty staying still
- **Small fingers**: Fingerprint capture may require multiple attempts
- **Height issues**: May need assistance reaching scanners
- **Attention span**: Processing may take longer than child's patience

### Managing Young Children (Under 6):

**Advantages**:
- No biometric registration required
- Faster processing through document verification
- Can accompany parents through expedited process

**Considerations**:
- Must stay with registered parent during their stay
- Cannot travel independently within Schengen area
- Compliance tracked through parent's EES record

## Family Compliance Tracking with EES

### Individual vs. Family Tracking:

**Important**: EES tracks each family member individually for 90/180-day compliance, even children. This means:

- **Each person** has separate entry/exit records
- **Different compliance statuses** possible within same family
- **Individual overstay risks** must be monitored
- **Coordinated planning** essential for family travel

### Family Scenarios and Solutions:

#### Scenario 1: Different Arrival Dates
**Situation**: Parent travels for business, family joins later
**EES Impact**: Each person's 90/180 period starts from their first entry
**Solution**: Track compliance separately, coordinate exit timing

#### Scenario 2: Extended Family Visits
**Situation**: Grandparents visiting family in EU for extended period
**EES Impact**: Elderly relatives may approach 90-day limits faster
**Solution**: Monitor all family members' compliance independently

#### Scenario 3: School-Age Children
**Situation**: Children on school holidays, parents working remotely
**EES Impact**: Different optimal stay durations for family members
**Solution**: Plan trips around individual compliance optimization

**Family Compliance Tool**: Our [Family Tracking System](/family) coordinates up to 4 family members' EES and Schengen compliance, providing visual coordination and automated alerts for the entire household.

## Preparing Children for EES: Age-Appropriate Guidance

### For Teenagers (12-17):
**Explanation**: "The EU is upgrading their security system to be more accurate and faster. Instead of stamping passports, they'll take your photo and fingerprints once, then use that to quickly identify you on future trips."

**Benefits to Emphasize**:
- Faster border crossings after first registration
- More accurate tracking prevents overstay problems
- Enhanced security makes travel safer for everyone

### For Children (6-11):
**Explanation**: "At the airport, they're going to take a special photo of you and might scan your fingers like in spy movies! It's to help them remember you so next time you visit Europe, they'll recognize you right away."

**Make it Fun**:
- Compare to superhero identity systems
- Practice "standing like a statue" for photos
- Explain it helps them travel like grown-ups

### For Young Children (Under 6):
**Explanation**: "You get to skip the special photo because you're too little! You just need to stay with mommy/daddy while they get their photo taken."

**Comfort Measures**:
- Bring favorite small toy or comfort item
- Plan for potential waiting during family processing
- Prepare snacks for longer border crossing times
