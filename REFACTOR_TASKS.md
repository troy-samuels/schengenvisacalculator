- **Phase 1**: Critical dependency and build fixes  
- **Phase 2**: Core consolidation and test infrastructure
- **Phase 3**: Progressive enhancement with performance optimization
- **Phase 4**: Integration testing and monitoring
- **Phase 5**: Platform features with feature flags
- **Phase 6**: Mobile app preparation and code sharing

---

## PHASE 0: Pre-Flight Checks (Day 0)
**Critical: Establish Baseline Before ANY Changes**

### Baseline Documentation
- [ ] Document current failing tests (screenshot/list all GitHub Actions failures)
- [ ] Record current bundle size (`npm run build` output)
- [ ] Save current Lighthouse scores (mobile + desktop)
- [ ] Export current dependency tree (`npm list --all > dependency-tree.txt`)
- [ ] Backup database schema (export from Supabase)
- [ ] Create feature branch `refactor/platform-enhancement`

**Success Criteria:** Complete documentation of current state

---

## PHASE 1: Foundation Stabilization (Days 1-2)
**Order Rationale: Fix dependencies FIRST to prevent cascading build failures**

### Day 1 Morning: Dependency Surgery
**⚠️ ORDER IS CRITICAL - Do in this exact sequence:**

1. [ ] Create clean package.json with pinned versions:
   - React: `18.3.1` (downgrade from 19)
   - Next.js: `14.2.5` (downgrade from 15.2.4)
   - All Radix UI: specific versions (no "latest")
   - date-fns: `^3.6.0` (no "latest")
   - Supabase: `^2.45.3` (no "latest")

2. [ ] Delete node_modules and package-lock.json completely
3. [ ] Install with `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` (first attempt)
4. [ ] Resolve any peer dependency conflicts manually
5. [ ] Run `npm run build` - **document ALL errors** (don't fix yet)
6. [ ] Run `npm test` - **document what fails** (baseline for comparison)

### Day 1 Afternoon: Build Configuration
7. [ ] Remove `eslint: { ignoreDuringBuilds: true }` from next.config.mjs
8. [ ] Remove `typescript: { ignoreBuildErrors: true }` from next.config.mjs  
9. [ ] Fix **ONLY critical TypeScript errors** blocking build (not warnings)
10. [ ] Create `tsconfig.strict.json` for gradual migration to strict mode

### Testing Checkpoint 1
- [ ] ✅ Build completes (warnings OK, errors not OK)
- [ ] ✅ Dev server starts (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] ✅ Basic navigation works (home → login → signup)
- [ ] ✅ **EU compliance tests: 100% pass rate** (`npm run test:eu`)
- [ ] ✅ **Performance benchmark: <50ms calculations** (`npm run benchmark`)
- [ ] ✅ **Bundle size: <200KB initial** (check build output)
- [ ] ✅ **PWA functionality intact** (service worker, offline status)
- [ ] Document remaining warnings for later phases

### Day 2: Surgical Removal  
**Order: Remove BEFORE consolidating to avoid fixing dead code**

11. [ ] Delete blog scheduler system (largest removal first):
    - `/app/api/blog-scheduler/` directory
    - `/app/admin/blog-scheduler/` directory
    - `/lib/blog-scheduler/` directory
    - `/lib/content-generation/` directory

12. [ ] Remove blog tests FIRST (prevent false test failures):
    - Any test files in deleted directories
    - Blog-related test imports in remaining files

13. [ ] Delete unused API routes:
    - `/app/api/content/`
    - `/app/api/notifications/` (unless actively used)
    - `/app/api/test-auth/`
    - `/app/api/robots/`
    - `/app/api/sitemap/`

14. [ ] Remove blog npm scripts from package.json:
    - `blog:setup`, `blog:status`, `blog:publish`
    - `content:generate*` scripts

15. [ ] **Run build after EACH deletion** (verify no new breaks)

### Testing Checkpoint 2
- [ ] ✅ All imports resolve (no module not found errors)
- [ ] ✅ No 404s on removed routes (test in browser)
- [ ] ✅ GitHub Actions attempts to run (may still fail but should start)
- [ ] ✅ **EU compliance tests: 100% pass rate** (`npm run test:eu`)
- [ ] ✅ **Performance maintained: <50ms calculations** (`npm run benchmark`)
- [ ] ✅ **Bundle size maintained: <200KB initial**

## CRITICAL CONSIDERATIONS FROM CLAUDE.MD

### Non-Negotiable Requirements
These requirements from CLAUDE.md must be maintained throughout ALL phases:

#### 1. EU Compliance Tests (CRITICAL)
- **100% pass rate required** - Never proceed if failing
- Run `npm run validate` before any major changes
- EU compliance tests are the single source of truth for calculator accuracy
- Any regression in EU compliance is a rollback trigger

#### 2. Performance Benchmarks (CRITICAL)
- **<50ms for calculations** (monitored at every checkpoint)
- **<200KB initial bundle size** (tracked in build output)
- Performance degradation >10% triggers immediate rollback
- Bundle size increase >20% requires optimization before proceeding

#### 3. Architecture Preservation (CRITICAL)
- **RobustSchengenCalculator** remains single source of truth
- **API-First Design** with `/api/v1/` versioning must be maintained
- **Mobile-first responsive design** principles preserved
- **PWA functionality** (service worker, offline capabilities) maintained

#### 4. Accessibility Standards (CRITICAL)
- **WCAG AA compliance** must be verified at every checkpoint
- **44x44px minimum touch targets** for mobile
- Screen reader compatibility maintained
- Keyboard navigation functional

#### 5. Database Operations Standards
- Browser-side: Use `lib/supabase/client.ts`
- API routes: Use `lib/supabase/server.ts`
- Follow Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing trip data

### Checkpoint Validation Requirements
Add these validations to EVERY testing checkpoint:

```bash
# Required at every checkpoint
npm run test:eu          # Must be 100% pass rate
npm run validate         # Complete validation suite
npm run lighthouse       # WCAG AA compliance check
npm run benchmark        # <50ms calculation verification

# Build size check
npm run build            # Verify <200KB initial bundle
```

### Component Consolidation Guidelines
Based on CLAUDE.md specifications:
- **Keep**: `mobile-optimized-calculator-fixed.tsx`
- **Remove**: `mobile-optimized-calculator.tsx`
- **Preserve**: All shadcn/ui component standards
- **Maintain**: Responsive breakpoints (640px, 768px, 1024px)

## Risk Mitigation

### Never Proceed to Next Phase If:
- Build is red
- **Core EU compliance tests failing (100% pass required)**
- **Performance degraded >10% from baseline (<50ms calculations)**
- **Bundle size increased >20% (target <200KB)**
- New security vulnerabilities introduced
- **Accessibility regression detected (WCAG AA required)**
- **PWA functionality broken**

### Rollback Triggers:
- Bundle size increase >20%
- Load time increase >1s
- Test coverage drop >10%
- EU compliance test failure
- Critical user path broken

### Emergency Procedures:
1. **Immediate rollback** to last known good state
2. **Hotfix branch** for critical issues
3. **Feature flag shutoff** for problematic features
4. **Communication plan** for stakeholders
5. **Post-incident review** and process improvement
