## ðŸ’° Focused Monetization Strategy

### Simplified Tier System (Compliance-Focused)
```typescript
// Schengen Compliance Tool Tiers
enum UserStatus {
  FREE = 'free',                  // Basic calculator, 5 trip limit
  LIFETIME = 'lifetime',          // Â£4.99 one-time - Family tracking + alerts
  ANNUAL = 'annual'               // Â£2.99/year - SMS alerts + priority support
}

// Compliance-First Feature Access Control
const COMPLIANCE_FEATURES = {
  [UserStatus.FREE]: [
    'basic_schengen_calculator',
    'trip_limit_5',
    'date_overlap_prevention',
    'screenshot_export'
  ],
  [UserStatus.LIFETIME]: [
    'unlimited_trips',
    'family_tracking_4_members',    // UNIQUE: Core competitive advantage

    'ad_free_experience'
  ],
  [UserStatus.ANNUAL]: [
    'all_lifetime_features',

## Development Guidelines

### Core Development Philosophy (Compliance-Focused Strategy)
- **Accuracy-First**: 100% EU compliance is non-negotiable
- **Family-Centric**: Multi-person tracking is primary competitive advantage
- **Mobile-First**: Every feature must work flawlessly on mobile
- **Sustainable Growth**: Focus on profitable features, avoid complexity
- **B2B Ready**: Architecture supports future corporate expansion
- **Zero Vulnerabilities**: Enterprise-grade security throughout

### ðŸš¨ **MANDATORY: MOBILE-FIRST + COMPLIANCE ACCURACY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**
**ALL CHANGES MUST INCLUDE MOBILE IMPLEMENTATION WITH 100% EU COMPLIANCE**
- Every UI change MUST work flawlessly on mobile with iOS-like smoothness
- Every calculation MUST pass 100% of EU compliance tests
- Every family feature MUST work seamlessly on mobile browsers
- Every date picker MUST prevent overlaps with visual indicators
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px with generous spacing
- **Performance**: <50ms for calculations, <200KB bundle
- **Compliance**: 100% pass rate on EU test cases (legal requirement)

### Testing Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Always run tests before committing: `npm run validate`
- **EU compliance tests must pass 100%** (legal requirement)
- **Date overlap prevention must be 100% accurate** (core feature)
- **Family coordination must work across all devices** (competitive advantage)
- **Performance benchmarks**: <50ms calculations, <200KB bundle
- **Mobile experience**: Touch-friendly with proper spacing

### Calculator Development
- **`RobustSchengenCalculator`** class is the source of truth (packages/calculator/)
- **Date Overlap Prevention** is CRITICAL - no date conflicts allowed
- Always validate against EU official test cases - 100% pass rate required
- Handle edge cases: leap years, timezone transitions, boundary conditions
- **Visual indicators**: Occupied dates must be greyed out with strikethrough
- **Family coordination**: Multiple family members with shared compliance

## ðŸš« CRITICAL: Date Overlap Prevention (Core Feature - All Tiers)

### Visual Implementation Requirements
```typescript
// Date picker visual states (MANDATORY)
const DATE_VISUAL_STATES = {
  occupied: 'bg-gray-200 text-gray-600 line-through cursor-not-allowed opacity-60',
  available: 'bg-gray-50 hover:bg-primary/10 cursor-pointer transition-colors',
  selected: 'bg-primary text-primary-foreground cursor-pointer',
  conflict: 'bg-red-100 text-red-700 cursor-not-allowed border border-red-200'
};
```

### Family Coordination System
```typescript
// Family member management (LIFETIME tier)
interface FamilyMember {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  nationality: string;
  relationship: 'self' | 'spouse' | 'child' | 'parent';
  trips: Trip[];
  complianceStatus: ComplianceResult;
  alerts: AlertPreference[];
}

// Shared family compliance
interface FamilyCompliance {
  familyId: string;
  members: FamilyMember[];
  sharedTrips: SharedTrip[];
  coordinatedAlerts: boolean;
  complianceOverview: FamilyComplianceResult;
}
```
